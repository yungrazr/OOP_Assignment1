#Sci-Fi UI
This is my first assignment project for OOP Year2, made in Processing

It is a sci-fi themed GUI which I named 'Virto UI' for the sake of giving it a name.

It consists of two main screens, Main Menu, and Main UI.

Main Menu is the first screen you see with a Launch & an Exit button.
MainUI is the GUI part of the project, consisting of some sci-fi spaceship-cockpit-type elements such as a radar, space grid, lever to control speed.
There's a sidepanel on the left side to allow acces to a few more options, such as planet info/statistics, which are read from a .csv file.
Minim lib was used to provide some cool space music, and for an equalizer in MainUI
